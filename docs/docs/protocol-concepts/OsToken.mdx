# osToken

## Introduction

osToken is a liquid staking token that accrues staking rewards when held. It is a generic name for StakeWise's network-specific ERC-20 tokens:

- **osETH** on Ethereum
- **osGNO** on Gnosis Chain

osToken is issued against assets staked in a Vault to allow using staked capital in decentralized applications to trade, borrow, lend, and restake. Hence, osTokens represent the underlying staked assets and the rewards earned.

Short for **Overcollateralized Staked Token**, osToken requires that the value of staked assets exceed the value of osToken issued. This overcollateralization acts as a safety buffer, protecting holders and the protocol from validator penalties or underperformance of permissionless Vaults.

A defining feature is that osToken can be minted against validators run by anyone ‚Äì from solo stakers to professional operators ‚Äì making access to liquid staking fully permissionless and non-custodial.

## How osToken Works

osToken turns staked ETH or GNO into liquid, yield-bearing assets. Its operation is governed by four core mechanisms:
minting, burning, exchange rate appreciation, and peg maintenance.

### Minting

Minting involves staking assets into a Vault and issuing osTokens against staked assets acting as collateral. Minting limits are in place to ensure each issued token is fully backed. These limits are set by the **Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio**.

#### Loan-to-Value Limits

The LTV ratio determines what portion of your stake can be tokenized with osToken:

| Vault Type     | Ethereum (osETH) | Gnosis (osGNO) | Safety Mechanism                 |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Standard       | 90% LTV          | 90% LTV        | 10% overcollateralization buffer |
| DAO-Approved   | 99.99% LTV       | 99.95% LTV     | 5M SWISE operator bond           |


<Admonition type="tip" icon="üß©" title="Example">
  With 100 ETH staked in a 90% LTV Vault at 1.05 exchange rate:

  - Maximum mintable osETH: `100 √ó 0.9 √∑ 1.05 = 85.71 osETH`
  - Overcollateralization: `10 ETH` remains as safety buffer
</Admonition>

#### Minting & Buying Options

osToken can be acquired via four methods:

1. **One-click staking** ‚Äì Deposit ETH or GNO through the [StakeWise App ‚Üó](https://app.stakewise.io/) to receive osETH or osGNO. No validator setup or Vault selection required.
2. **Staking with Vaults** ‚Äì Select a specific Vault (operator, fees, performance). Rewards and penalties are isolated per Vault. Minting capacity is constrained by LTV limits.
3. **Solo staking** ‚Äì Operate private validators and mint osTokens against self-staked collateral, retaining full infrastructure control. Minting capacity is constrained by LTV limits.
4. **DEX purchase** ‚Äì Acquire osTokens on decentralized exchanges. Tokens have the same exchange-rate appreciation as minted tokens and do not create a Vault position (no LTV or liquidation exposure).

All methods yield the same asset that appreciates through the same exchange rate mechanism.

#### Position Health

Position health is continuously tracked through LTV thresholds:

| Status     | LTV Range     | Description                          |
|------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Healthy    | ‚â§ 90%        | Within Vault's safe operating limit  |
| Moderate   | (90%, 91%]   | Exceeds limit, partial redemption available |
| Risky      | (91%, 92%]   | Approaching liquidation threshold    |
| Unhealthy  | > 92%        | Eligible for liquidation             |

><span style={{color: '#1f2937', fontWeight: '500'}}>üí°`[ ]` includes value, `( )` excludes value.</span>

Users can maintain healthy positions by keeping LTV well below limits, adding more collateral, or burning osToken.
In 99.99% (osETH) / 99.95% (osGNO) Vaults, redemptions and liquidations do not apply, positions remain healthy by design.

### Burning

Burning is the process of returning minted osTokens to the Vault in exchange for unlocking the staked collateral that backs them.
To fully unstake, a user must burn the entire amount of osTokens they minted, plus any protocol fees accrued.

Partial burns are also possible, allowing users to reduce debt, improve position health, or free up a portion of their stake.
The burn amount is calculated using the current fair exchange rate to ensure that the redeemed assets always match the true underlying value of the returned tokens.

The amount of ETH that can be unstaked at any moment is determined by maintaining the osToken position within its healthy Loan-to-Value (LTV) range.
After unstaking, the value of minted osETH must remain at or below:
- **90%** of staked ETH in a **90% LTV Vault**
- **99.99%** of staked ETH in a **99.99% LTV Vault**

The protocol calculates the **maximum unstakable ETH** as:

<Admonition type="formula" icon="üìê" title="Formula ‚Äì 90% LTV" className="admonition--formula">
$$
{\small MaxUnstakeableETH = StakedETH - \dfrac{osETHMinted \times ExchangeRate}{0.9}}
$$
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="formula" icon="üìê" title="Formula ‚Äì 99.99% LTV" className="admonition--formula">
$$
{\small MaxUnstakeableETH = StakedETH - \dfrac{osETHMinted \times ExchangeRate}{0.9999}}
$$
</Admonition>

#### 90% LTV Vault

Bob stakes **100 ETH** and mints **50 osETH** at an exchange rate of **1.05 ETH/osETH**.
- Value of minted osETH: `50 √ó 1.05 = 52.5 ETH`
- Position health: `52.5 √∑ 100 = 52.5%` ‚Üí safely below **90%**
- Maximum unstakable ETH: `100 ‚àí (52.5 √∑ 0.9) = 41.667 ETH`

After unstaking **41.667 ETH**, Bob‚Äôs position health = **90%**

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip" icon="üß©" title="Example">

#### 99.99% LTV Vault

Alice stakes **100 ETH** and mints **50 osETH** at the same **1.05** rate.
- Value of minted osETH: `52.5 ETH`
- Position health: `52.5 √∑ 100 = 52.5%` ‚Üí well below **99.99%**
- Maximum unstakable ETH: `100 ‚àí (52.5 √∑ 0.9999) = 47.495 ETH`

After unstaking **47.495 ETH**, Alice‚Äôs position health = **99.99%**

</Admonition>

### Peg Maintenance

osToken maintains a soft peg to its underlying asset (ETH or GNO) through minting, redemptions, and liquidations.
Minting helps prevent secondary market premiums on osTokens.
Redemption acts as early intervention when a position drifts toward risky erosion of collateral,
while liquidation serves as the last resort for closing thinly collateralized positions.
Together, they create arbitrage opportunities that keep osToken‚Äôs market price closely aligned with its fair exchange rate.

#### Redemption Mechanism

In **90% LTV Vaults**, the redemption mechanism activates when a position‚Äôs Loan-to-Value (LTV) reaches the **redemption threshold of 91.5%**.
At this point, anyone can burn part of that position‚Äôs osTokens in exchange for an equivalent share of the Vault‚Äôs collateral.
The burn amount is calculated so that the position‚Äôs LTV is restored precisely to 90%.
Importantly, the staker whose tokens are redeemed does not lose value ‚Äì they keep the osTokens burned on their behalf.

The redeemable amount is calculated as:

<Admonition type="formula" icon="üìê" title="Formula" className="admonition--formula">
$$
{\small Redeemable\ osETH = \frac{10 \times Minted\ osETH - 9 \times Staked\ ETH}{Exchange\ Rate}}
$$
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip" icon="üß©" title="Example">

Bob stakes **100 ETH** and mints **87.238 osETH** at an exchange rate of **1.05 ETH/osETH**.

- Value of minted osETH:
  `87.238 √ó 1.05 = 91.687.238 ETH`

- Loan-to-Value (LTV):
${\footnotesize\dfrac{91.687}{100} = 91.6\% }$
  ‚Üí slightly above the **91.5% redemption threshold**.

Applying the formula:

$$
  {\small Redeemable\ osETH = \frac{10 \times 87.238 - 9 \times 100}{1.05} = 15.238}
$$

A redeemer burns **15.238 osETH** and receives **16 ETH** from the Vault.

After redemption:
- Bob‚Äôs minted balance = **72 osETH**
- Bob‚Äôs staked collateral = **84 ETH**
- LTV = **90%** (restored to safety)

Importantly, Bob **retains the 15.238 osETH burned on his behalf**, so his **total position value is unchanged**.

</Admonition>

Positions in **99.99% LTV Vaults** are also subject to redemption, with amounts redeemed determined by the protocol‚Äôs redemption request volume.
The LTV of redeemed positions will remain above or equal to 99.99% after the redemption, not affecting the owner of the position in any scenario.

#### Liquidation Mechanism

Liquidation is the system‚Äôs final safeguard, closing unhealthy positions to protect overcollateralization.
In **90% LTV Vaults**, if a position exceeds the **92% LTV liquidation threshold**, anyone can close it entirely by burning all minted osTokens against the collateral.
The liquidator receives the underlying collateral value plus a **1% liquidation premium**, which is deducted from the staker‚Äôs collateral as a penalty.

The ETH payout to the liquidator is calculated as:

<Admonition type="formula" icon="üìê" title="Formula" className="admonition--formula">
$$
{\small ETH\ Payout = (Minted\ osETH \times Exchange\ Rate) \times 1.01}
$$
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip" icon="üß©" title="Example">

Alice stakes **100 ETH** and mints **87.629 osETH** at an exchange rate of **1.05 ETH/osETH**.

- Value of minted osETH:
  `87.629 √ó 1.05 = 92.01 ETH`

- Loan-to-Value (LTV):
${\footnotesize \dfrac{92.01}{100} = 92.01\% }$
  ‚Üí above the **92% liquidation threshold**.

Applying the formula:

$$
{\small ETH\ Payout = (87.629 \times 1.05) \times 1.01 = 92.93\ ETH}
$$

A liquidator burns **87.629 osETH** (worth **92.01 ETH**) and, with the **1% premium**, receives **92.93 ETH** from the Vault.

After liquidation:
- Alice‚Äôs minted balance = **0 osETH**
- Alice‚Äôs staked collateral = **7.07 ETH**
- She still holds the **87.629 osETH** she minted earlier

The **loss of 1% collateral** is the direct penalty for breaching safe LTV limits.

</Admonition>

Positions in **99.99% LTV Vaults** are exempt from liquidation, as their APY parity ensures position health remains stable.

### Exchange Rate Appreciation

osToken is a **repricing token**, meaning its redemption value increases over time as staking rewards accrue.
Each osToken represents a growing share of the underlying staked ETH or GNO.

The **fair exchange rate** is the amount of assets a user can receive when redeeming osToken within the protocol.
As rewards accrue, the redemption value increases, creating the ‚Äúrepricing‚Äù effect where e.g. each osETH becomes worth more ETH.


The fair exchange rate is reflected through `convertToAssets` and `convertToShares` functions in the [osTokenVaultController ‚Üó](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2A261e60FB14586B474C208b1B7AC6D0f5000306#code) contract,
which manages osToken supply, collateral, and reward accrual.

### Reward Accrual & Fee Mechanism
A decentralized Oracle network uses the [VaultUserLtvTracker ‚Üó](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe0ae8b04922d6e3fa06c2496a94ef2875efcc7bb#code) contract to identify the user with the highest osToken LTV position across all Vaults.
Oracles then set the `avgRewardPerSecond` parameter to match  that user's Vault APY performance.
This rate drives the continuous calculation of osToken value appreciation:

<Admonition type="formula" icon="üìê" title="Formula" className="admonition--formula">
$$
{\small profitAccrued = avgRewardPerSecond \times totalAssets \times timeElapsed}
$$
</Admonition>

This mechanism ensures that osETH appreciation keeps pace with the least collateralized position in the entire protocol.
When necessary, Oracles adjust `avgRewardPerSecond` downward to prevent any LTV from exceeding 100% due to insufficient Vault performance.

From these rewards, the protocol deducts a 5% fee that increases users' osETH debt - the amount they must burn to fully exit their positions.
This fee creates new tokens for the StakeWise DAO Treasury and increases the osETH balance that users owe back to their Vaults.
The remaining 95% of rewards increase the backing assets, raising the fair exchange rate for all osToken holders.

<Admonition type="tip" icon="üß©" title="Example">
  If you minted **1 osToken** and after fee collection it increases to **1.000001**,
  your debt grows by **0.000001** ‚Äî your proportional share of the protocol's accumulated fees.
