# osToken

## Introduction

osToken is a liquid staking token that accrues staking rewards when held. It is a generic name for StakeWise's network-specific ERC-20 tokens:

- **osETH** on Ethereum
- **osGNO** on Gnosis Chain

osToken is issued against assets staked in a Vault to allow using staked capital in decentralized applications to trade, borrow, lend, and restake. Hence, osTokens represent the underlying staked assets and the rewards earned.

Short for **Overcollateralized Staked Token**, osToken requires that the value of staked assets exceed the value of osToken issued. This overcollateralization acts as a safety buffer, protecting holders and the protocol from validator penalties or underperformance of permissionless Vaults.

A defining feature is that osToken can be minted against validators run by anyone ‚Äì from solo stakers to professional operators ‚Äì making access to liquid staking fully permissionless and non-custodial.

## How osToken Works

osToken turns staked ETH or GNO into liquid, yield-bearing assets. Its operation is governed by four core mechanisms:
minting, burning, exchange rate appreciation, and peg maintenance.

### Minting

Minting involves staking assets into a Vault and issuing osTokens against staked assets acting as collateral. Minting limits are in place to ensure each issued token is fully backed. These limits are set by the **Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio**.

#### Loan-to-Value Limits

The LTV ratio determines what portion of your stake can be tokenized with osToken:

| Vault Type     | Ethereum (osETH) | Gnosis (osGNO) | Safety Mechanism                 |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Standard       | 90% LTV          | 90% LTV        | 10% overcollateralization buffer |
| DAO-Approved   | 99.99% LTV       | 99.95% LTV     | 5M SWISE operator bond           |


<Admonition type="tip" icon="üß©" title="Example">
  With 100 ETH staked in a 90% LTV Vault at 1.05 exchange rate:

  - Maximum mintable osETH: `100 √ó 0.9 √∑ 1.05 = 85.71 osETH`
  - Overcollateralization: `10 ETH` remains as safety buffer

#### Minting & Buying Options

osToken can be acquired via four methods:

1. **One-click staking** ‚Äì Deposit ETH or GNO through the [StakeWise App ‚Üó](https://app.stakewise.io/) to receive osETH or osGNO. No validator setup or Vault selection required.
2. **Staking with Vaults** ‚Äì Select a specific Vault (operator, fees, performance). Rewards and penalties are isolated per Vault. Minting capacity is constrained by LTV limits.
3. **Solo staking** ‚Äì Operate private validators and mint osTokens against self-staked collateral, retaining full infrastructure control. Minting capacity is constrained by LTV limits.
4. **DEX purchase** ‚Äì Acquire osTokens on decentralized exchanges. Tokens have the same exchange-rate appreciation as minted tokens and do not create a Vault position (no LTV or liquidation exposure).

All methods yield the same asset that appreciates through the same exchange rate mechanism.

#### Position Health

Position health is continuously tracked through LTV thresholds:

| Status     | LTV Range     | Description                          |
|------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Healthy    | ‚â§ 90%        | Within Vault's safe operating limit  |
| Moderate   | (90%, 91%]   | Exceeds limit, partial redemption available |
| Risky      | (91%, 92%]   | Approaching liquidation threshold    |
| Unhealthy  | > 92%        | Eligible for liquidation             |

><span style={{color: '#1f2937', fontWeight: '500'}}>üí°`[ ]` includes value, `( )` excludes value.</span>

Users can maintain healthy positions by keeping LTV well below limits, adding more collateral, or burning osToken.
In 99.99% (osETH) / 99.95% (osGNO) Vaults, redemptions and liquidations do not apply, positions remain healthy by design.

### Burning

Burning is the process of returning minted osTokens to the Vault in exchange for unlocking the staked collateral that backs them.
To fully unstake, a user must burn the entire amount of osTokens they minted, plus any protocol fees accrued.

Partial burns are also possible, allowing users to reduce debt, improve position health, or free up a portion of their stake.
The burn amount is calculated using the current fair exchange rate to ensure that the redeemed assets always match the true underlying value of the returned tokens.

The amount of ETH that can be unstaked at any moment is determined by maintaining the osToken position within its healthy Loan-to-Value (LTV) range.
After unstaking, the value of minted osETH must remain at or below:
- **90%** of staked ETH in a **90% LTV Vault**
- **99.99%** of staked ETH in a **99.99% LTV Vault**

The protocol calculates the **maximum unstakable ETH** as:
