# The StakeWise Protocol

<h3>Introduction</h3>

This documentation is designed to help you understand and build with StakeWise V3. It covers the protocol fundamentals, explains the technical architecture, and provides practical guides for staking, operating, and developing on the platform.

Whether you are taking your first steps into liquid staking, running infrastructure, or navigating as a seasoned DeFi user, these pages guide you in unlocking the potential of capital.

<h3>What is StakeWise?</h3>

StakeWise V3 is the premier liquid staking protocol on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain, enabling simple and secure staking for individuals and organizations. It also provides tools and software that allow anyone to launch their own staking pool (called a Vault) and earn fees by running validators for others.

Our design philosophy is simple: advancing decentralization by giving anyone the chance to stake on their own terms. At the core of this vision are user empowerment and flexibility in creating solutions. Anyone can leverage StakeWise to achieve their unique staking goals. The system is maximally customizable and secure, offering diverse staking solutions for every user type.

<h3>Core Architecture</h3>

StakeWise's architecture rests on three foundational pillars: Vaults, osETH tokens, and Oracles.

<h4>Vaults</h4>
StakeWise pioneers the Vault marketplace model. Anyone can launch a Vault, stake in Vaults, and mint osETH, with Vault operators earning a staking fee in exchange while maintaining the highest level of security.

<h4>osETH</h4>
osETH is a token for liquid staking that accrues ETH rewards to its holders. osETH is minted by stakers in Vaults who want to use their stake in DeFi. Anyone can swap their ETH for osETH in DeFi to start earning ETH rewards by holding the token.

<h4>Oracles</h4>
Oracles ensure that Vaults register validators without assuming custody of funds, calculate Vault rewards, and push information about validator registrations and exits on-chain.

<h3>The Art of Liquid Staking</h3>
Liquid staking is the ability to turn your stake into its tokenized representation by receiving receipt tokens (LST). 'Staking' refers to providing capital to secure a blockchain consensus mechanism by locking up cryptocurrency (like ETH or GNO) and earning rewards in return, while 'liquid' refers to keeping your assets tradable and composable instead of locked.
The art of liquid staking lies in maximizing yield while minimizing risk. StakeWise accomplishes this pursuit through its underlying architecture to unlock greater rewards securely. This security comes from osETH's overcollateralization mechanism, the decentralized Oracle network, customizable Vault configurations, and the choice to set your own staking conditions. StakeWise stays aligned with Ethereum's roadmap, researching upcoming changes and adapting proactively for optimal performance.
