# The StakeWise Protocol

<h2>Introduction</h2>

StakeWise is a decentralized protocol for liquid staking on Ethereum. Rather than consist of one large staking pool, StakeWise has a network of permissionless, customizable, and non-custodial staking pools deployed by various service providers, allowing individuals and organizations to pick which nodes will stake their ETH, helping them find the most suitable staking arrangement. All pools offer on-demand liquidity and DeFi integrations for users‚Äô stake via osToken, providing the flexibility to get the token only when needed. The protocol is implemented as a mix of both upgradable (via dual governance) smart contracts that must keep up with the changes in Ethereum‚Äôs Proof-of-Stake specification, and persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts designed to prioritize security and self-custody, and to function without centralized intermediaries who may selectively restrict access to the service.

This documentation explains the modular architecture of Infinity Pools ‚Äî the smart contracts that enable non-custodial, customizable, and permissionless staking ‚Äî and the tokenization of stake via osToken. It offers in-depth coverage of protocol mechanics and possible software configurations, and provides step-by-step guides for full potential. Whether you're new to liquid staking or are an experienced user, this documentation gives you everything needed for a confident start.

<h2>Understanding Liquid Staking</h2>

<h3>The Traditional Staking Dilemma</h3>
<h4>What is Staking?</h4>
Staking is a cryptoeconomic mechanism that uses rewards and penalties to incentivize proper network behavior, thereby enhancing the underlying security. In proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains like Ethereum, participants run <Tooltip content={<><strong>Validator</strong> <br /> A <a href="./glossary#node" style={{textDecoration: 'underline', color: '#018970'}}>node</a> in a proof-of-stake system responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain. To activate validator software, you need to be able to stake 32 ETH.</>}>validator</Tooltip> nodes by putting tokens "at stake", meaning they earn rewards for validating transactions while risking "slashing" (penalties) for malicious or unreliable behavior. Validators play an essential role in maintaining network consensus, enabling all participants to agree on the blockchain's new irreversible global state. For this critical work, validators receive two types of rewards:

  <li><span style={{fontWeight: '600'}}>Consensus Layer rewards</span>: Earned by performing validator duties like voting on block validity through attestations, participating in sync committees, and proposing blocks</li>
  <li><span style={{fontWeight: '600'}}>Execution Layer rewards</span>: Received as priority fees and Maximum Extractable Value (MEV)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Liquidity Problem</h3>
Traditional PoS staking operates on a simple premise: lock tokens, earn fixed rewards, repeat. While this bond-like approach guarantees returns, it has a significant limitation: stake is illiquid. You are locked out of decentralized finance (DeFi) yield opportunities. Traditional staking creates a fundamental dilemma: you must choose between earning staking rewards and maintaining liquidity for ETH, but never both.

<h3>Solution</h3>
<h4>How Liquid Staking Works</h4>
Liquid staking transforms your stake into a tradeable asset through tokenization. When you stake through a liquid staking protocol, you receive liquid staking tokens (LSTs) representing your claim on the underlying staked assets plus accrued rewards. Unlike native staking where tokens are locked, LSTs remain liquid and composable. This unlocks the entire DeFi ecosystem while your original stake continues earning validation rewards. You can now earn from multiple sources:

- Staking rewards from your underlying validators;
- DeFi yields from a multitude of opportunities: collateral for lending, yield farming strategies, or trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs);

‚Ä¶ while keeping your stake transferable and easily convertible back into ETH.

Liquid staking represents an epistemic shift in how staking works. With LSTs, you maintain exposure to staking rewards while having liquidity, breaking the disjunctive premise of traditional staking.

<h3>Staking Options</h3>
In order to participate in the Ethereum consensus mechanism, a staker must deposit 32 ETH.

The default way to stake - called solo staking - can be prohibitive because of the minimum required 32 ETH and the technical expertise required to run a node. This accessibility barrier led to the emergence of staking service providers that require no programming knowledge or hardware setup: staking-as-a-service (SaaS) and centralized exchanges (CEXs). However, both come with significant concessions: SaaS providers still require the full 32 ETH minimum and offer no liquidity benefits, while centralized exchanges have one fundamental flaw ‚Äî centralization, which contradicts crypto's core decentralization principles.

Decentralized liquid staking protocols emerged as a response - they don‚Äôt have a deposit minimum, instead ‚Äúpooling‚Äù capital from many depositors, and issuing tokens that represent depositors‚Äô share of the staking pool. These tokens are typically tradable on decentralized exchanges and are accepted as collateral in lending protocols, enabling frictionless entry and exit from staking, as well as participation in DeFi.

By nature of their service, liquid staking protocols are non-custodial and permissionless. However, their weakness is the standardized nature of the service - users don‚Äôt have the flexibility to control how and on what terms their assets are staked, and must always stake ETH on third-party nodes to access liquidity, commingling assets with other depositors. Such protocols also mostly rely on opaque node operator sets, often creating centralization around dominant node operators and leaving participants without transparency about stake allocation.

This opens room for an innovative approach to liquid staking pioneered by StakeWise.

<h2>What is StakeWise?</h2>
StakeWise is a liquid staking protocol that gives you the benefits of permissionless and non-custodial liquid staking without the trade-offs.

Operating across Ethereum and Gnosis Chain, StakeWise creates a comprehensive staking network that serves diverse participants through three distinct approaches:

**Infinity Pools**: For advanced users seeking full control, choose from diverse staking pool offerings with distinct fee structures, MEV strategies, and risk profiles, empowering you to easily earn staking yields with complete control over your assets and validator selection. Instant liquidity and DeFi integrations are available on-demand by opting to receive OsToken when staking.

**One-Click Staking**: For users who want to start earning immediately without thinking twice, go for streamlined staking that automatically allocates your stake across proven Infinity Pools that minimize fees and maximize your yield. OsToken is issued automatically, granting access to instant liquidity and DeFi by default.

**Run Own Infinity Pool**: For users and organizations that seek to run their own nodes to access liquidity for their stake, or offer a staking service to others, Infinity Pools allow you to set up isolated, non-custodial, and customizable staking environments that preserve optional access to liquidity via OsToken. Infinity Pools already handle billions of US dollars worth of staked assets, powering solutions from MetaMask, Chorus One, [Blockchain.com](http://Blockchain.com), Ledger Live, and others.

StakeWise's product offering emerged from deep analysis of stakeholder motivations, creating a structure that reinforces our decentralized vision while sustainably scaling Ethereum staking. StakeWise also continuously develops innovative strategies to maximize your rewards, such as Boost, with more features coming soon.

<h3>Architecture</h3>
StakeWise's modular architecture is built on three foundational pillars: Infinity Pools, OsToken, and Oracles.

<h4>Infinity Pools: Customizable Smart Contracts</h4>
Infinity Pools are isolated, highly customizable smart contracts that function as individual staking pools. Pool operators can accept deposits from other stakers, earning fees while providing staking services. The marketplace model democratizes liquid staking by giving you the freedom to choose where to stake and how.

<h4>Key Features:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Permissionless & Customizable: Launch your own Infinity Pool without approval, controlling fees, MEV strategies, and validator selection. Manage access by making your Pool private or <Tooltip content={<><strong>OFAC-compliant</strong> <br /> Compliance with the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations, which may restrict access to certain jurisdictions or sanctioned entities.</>}>OFAC-compliant</Tooltip></li>
  <li>Open Marketplace: Choose from diverse Infinity Pools based on your preferences for decentralization, yield, or specialized strategies</li>
  <li>Risk Isolation: Each Infinity Pool operates independently ‚Äî issues in one Pool don't affect others</li>
</ul>

<h4>OsToken: Next-Generation Liquid Staking Tokens</h4>
OsToken, standing for Overcollateralized Staking Token, is StakeWise's liquid staking token: osETH on Ethereum and osGNO on Gnosis Chain. Designed with safety and composability at its core, OsToken accrues staking rewards while maintaining full liquidity for DeFi participation. OsToken can be minted by anyone staking in Infinity Pools or acquired directly from a DEX to instantly start earning staking rewards.

<h4>Key Features:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Protected & Rewarding: Overcollateralized design with auto-compounding rewards and slashing protection</li>
  <li>DeFi Ready: Fully compatible with lending, trading, and yield farming protocols</li>
</ul>

<h4>Oracles: Decentralized Infrastructure Layer</h4>
The decentralized oracle network bridges StakeWise smart contracts with Ethereum's <Tooltip content={<><strong>Beacon Chain</strong> <br /> Ethereum's consensus layer, a peer-to-peer network of consensus clients that handles block gossip and consensus logic. It is responsible for things like block and attestation handling, running the fork choice algorithm, and managing rewards and penalties for validators.</>}>Beacon Chain</Tooltip>, ensuring transparent, trustless operations while maintaining the protocol's security and non-custodial nature. Since Beacon Chain state is not directly accessible in the EVM (though [EIP-4788](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4788) aims to address this), oracles fetch essential validator data.

<h4>Key Functions:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Validator Lifecycle: Handle registration, consolidations, rewards, penalties, and exits</li>
  <li>Token Stability: Maintain accurate OsToken rates and ensure peg stability</li>
</ul>
