# The StakeWise Protocol

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This documentation helps you stake and operate with StakeWise in a fully non-custodial, permissionless, and customizable way. It walks you through the protocol fundamentals, explains how everything works under the hood, and gives you the tools to get started confidently. Whether you're new to liquid staking, running your own infrastructure, or deep into DeFi, you'll find what you need to unlock the full potential of your capital.

<h2>Understanding Liquid Staking</h2>

<h3>The Traditional Staking Dilemma</h3>
<h4>What is Staking?</h4>
Staking is a cryptoeconomic mechanism that uses rewards and penalties to incentivize proper network behavior, thereby enhancing underlying security. In proof-of-stake based blockchains like Ethereum, network participants run validator nodes by putting tokens "at stake", which earn rewards for validating transactions but can also be "slashed" (taken as penalty) if the validator acts maliciously or unreliably.

<h4>How Consensus Works</h4>
Validators earn rewards for their essential role in maintaining network consensus. The consensus mechanism allows the participants to agree on the new global state of the blockchain. Different consensus mechanisms exist  ‚Äî proof-of-authority, proof-of-work, or proof-of-history ‚Äî  but they all serve as economic civil resistance. In the voting game of proposing blocks, participation requires staking economic resources. In Ethereum's case, this means ETH, where each validator's influence is proportional to their staked amount.

<h4>Validator Rewards</h4>
Validators receive two types of rewards:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consensus Layer rewards</strong>: Earned by performing validator duties like voting on block validity through attestations, participating in sync committees, and proposing blocks</li>
  <li><strong>Execution Layer rewards</strong>: Received as priority fees and Maximum Extractable Value (MEV)</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Liquidity Problem</h4>
Traditional PoS staking operates on a simple premise: lock tokens, earn fixed rewards, repeat. While this bond-like approach guarantees returns, it has a severe limitation: stake is illiquid. You are locked out of decentralized finance (DeFi) yield opportunities. Traditional staking created a fundamental dilemma: you had to choose between earning staking rewards or maintaining liquidity. Liquid staking transcends this either-or paradigm by having the best of both worlds.

<h3>Solution</h3>
<h4>How Liquid Staking Works</h4>
Liquid staking transforms your stake into a tradeable asset through tokenization. When you stake cryptocurrency through a liquid staking protocol, you receive liquid staking tokens (LSTs) that represent your claim on the underlying staked assets plus accrued rewards. These tokens function as liquid representations of your stake, maintaining its value while making it tradeable.

<h4>Key Benefits</h4>
Unlike native staking where tokens are locked, LSTs remain freely transferable and liquid. With liquid staking tokens, you unlock the entire DeFi ecosystem while your original stake continues earning validation rewards. You can now earn rewards from both:
- Staking rewards from your underlying validators
- DeFi yields by using your tokens as collateral for lending, in yield farming strategies, or trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)

Liquid staking represents an epistemic shift in how staking must work. By holding LSTs, you've effectively built a personal bank that earns staking rewards while participating in DeFi's endless opportunities.

<h3>Staking Options</h3>
In order to participate in the Ethereum consensus mechanism, a staker must deposit 32 ETH. **Solo staking** can be prohibitive for those who don't have 32 ETH minimum required by Ethereum and the requisite technical acumen. Traditional alternatives that require no in-depth programming knowledge or hardware setup include **staking-as-a-service (SaaS)** providers or **centralized exchanges**, but both come with trade-offs: SaaS providers still require the full 32 ETH minimum and provide no liquid staking benefits, while centralized exchanges have one intrinsic flaw: centralization, which contradicts crypto's original decentralization ethos. While APRs may appear attractive, "not your keys, not your crypto," as the saying goes.

<h3>Decentralized Staking</h3>
Decentralized liquid staking services eliminate financial and technical barriers to maximize your stake while letting you participate in DeFi. You can stake any amount you wish in a permissionless and non-custodial manner. **Smart contracts** ensure that your funds remain secure and under your control ‚Äî no centralized entity can access or confiscate your staked assets, as all operations are governed by transparent, immutable code on the blockchain. Beyond the classical risk considerations ‚Äî slashing, exploits, secondary market volatility ‚Äî liquid staking protocols face an equally important architectural choice: validator selection and control. Most liquid staking protocols use pre-configured validator sets, which can lead to centralization around the biggest node operators. As a staker, you don't know where your stake will end up or have any say in the matter. This design choice fundamentally shapes your staking experience and your ability to actively participate in network decentralization. Some protocols prioritize operational simplicity with managed validator sets, while others prioritize user agency and transparency in validator selection.

<h2>What is StakeWise?</h2>

StakeWise is the premier liquid staking protocol on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain, offering secure, non-custodial staking for individuals and organizations. It‚Äôs fully permissionless and built for flexibility. For even more control, you can run your own Vault ‚Äî with no deposit requirements and complete ownership over your setup.

Our design philosophy is simple: push decentralization forward by letting anyone stake on their own terms.

<h3>Vault System</h3>
StakeWise puts control in your hands with our flexible Vault system. You can actively support decentralization by running your own node or choosing trusted operators that match your staking goals through our open marketplace. With no deposit requirements, anyone can launch and configure a Vault ‚Äî a personal staking pool ‚Äî using our open-source tools and start earning fees by running validators for others.

<h3>Technical Benefits</h3>
This architecture gives you control over the entire staking stack ‚Äî from validator selection and fee structures to MEV strategies and risk settings ‚Äî while staying true to the non-custodial, permissionless principles of DeFi. You choose what matters: operators, fees, MEV relays, use of DVT, slashing insurance, and more. Whether you're a solo staker, institutional investor, or infrastructure provider, StakeWise lets you run nodes, mint LSTs, and plug into DeFi ‚Äî all while keeping full custody of your assets.

<h3>Yield Enhancement</h3>
StakeWise builds different yield amplification strategies to maximize your staking returns, with **Boost** being our recent offering and more innovative strategies in development. Boost can literally boost your staking rewards by up to 3x. Using OsToken as collateral, Boost safely borrows additional ETH to create a looped staking position, allowing you to earn the surplus between staking rewards and borrowing costs ‚Äî all while maintaining built-in safety mechanisms to prevent liquidation risks. In DeFi jargon, this process is called leveraged staking: you borrow osETH and stake it again, increasing your exposure to staking rewards.

<h3>Token Utility</h3>
StakeWise makes staked assets liquid through OsToken ‚Äî osETH on Ethereum and osGNO on Gnosis Chain. These tokens accrue rewards over time and can be used across DeFi to trade, farm, and unlock even more yield from your staked capital.

<h3>Future Vision</h3>
StakeWise stays aligned with Ethereum's roadmap, researching upcoming changes and adapting proactively for optimal performance while fostering the decentralization that is essential for Ethereum's long-term health.

<h2>Core Architecture</h2>

StakeWise's modular architecture is built on three foundational pillars that work together to deliver a permissionless, non-custodial liquid staking experience: Vaults, OsToken, and Oracles.

<h3>Vaults</h3>
StakeWise pioneers the Vault marketplace model ‚Äî a revolutionary approach that democratizes liquid staking. Vaults are isolated, highly customizable smart contracts that function as individual staking pools, each with their own terms, operators, and configurations.

**Key Features:**
<ul>
  <li><strong>Permissionless Creation</strong>: Anyone can launch their own Vault without approval or collateral requirements</li>
  <li><strong>Full Customization</strong>: Vault operators control fee structures, MEV strategies, client diversity, slashing insurance, and validator selection</li>
  <li><strong>Open Marketplace</strong>: Stakers can choose from diverse Vaults based on their preferences for decentralization, yield, safety, or specialized strategies</li>
  <li><strong>Isolation Model</strong>: Each Vault operates independently, ensuring that issues in one Vault don't affect others</li>
</ul>

Whether you're a solo staker wanting to mint liquid tokens against your own node, an institution requiring regulatory compliance, or a DeFi protocol seeking specific staking strategies, Vaults provide the flexibility to stake on your exact terms.

<h3>OsToken</h3>

OsToken represents the next generation of liquid staking tokens, available as osETH on Ethereum and osGNO on Gnosis Chain. These tokens are designed with safety and composability at their core.

**Key Features:**
<ul>
  <li><strong>Auto-Compounding Rewards</strong>: OsToken automatically accrues staking rewards, reflected in its increasing redemption value</li>
  <li><strong>Built-in Slashing Protection</strong>: Overcollateralized design with excess reserve buffers protects holders from validator slashing events</li>
  <li><strong>DeFi Composability</strong>: Fully compatible with DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, yield farming, and trading</li>
  <li><strong>Liquidation Risk Minimized</strong>: Uses stable native rate feeds instead of volatile market prices, eliminating depeg-related liquidation risks</li>
  <li><strong>Universal Backing</strong>: Backed by a diverse, decentralized network of Vaults across the entire StakeWise ecosystem</li>
</ul>

OsToken can be minted by anyone staking in Vaults (up to 90-100% of their stake value) or acquired directly from Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) to instantly start earning staking rewards.

<h3>Oracles</h3>
StakeWise Oracles serve as the critical infrastructure layer that maintains the protocol's security, accuracy, and non-custodial nature. This decentralized network ensures all on-chain operations reflect real validator performance and network state.

**Key Features:**
<ul>
  <li><strong>Validator Registration</strong>: Validate and sign new validator registrations and consolidations</li>
  <li><strong>Reward and Penalty Calculation</strong>: Periodically vote for the rewards/penalties accumulated by the Vaults in the <Tooltip definition="Ethereum's proof-of-stake consensus layer that coordinates validators, handles block validation, and manages staking rewards and penalties">Beacon Chain</Tooltip> and execution rewards (MEV and priority fees) for the Vaults connected to the smoothing pool</li>
  <li><strong>Exit Management</strong>: Process and validate validator exits and withdrawals</li>
  <li><strong>Rate Updates</strong>: Maintain accurate exchange rates for OsToken redemption values and participate in peg stability</li>
</ul>
