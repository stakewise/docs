# The StakeWise Protocol

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This documentation helps you use StakeWise for staking and offering staking services. It explains the modular architecture of Vaults ‚Äî the smart contracts that enable non-custodial, customizable, and permissionless staking ‚Äî and the tokenomics behind OsToken's instant liquidity. It provides both theoretical understanding of protocol mechanics and practical acumen to unlock your capital's full potential. Whether you're new to liquid staking, running your own infrastructure, or deep into DeFi, it gives you everything needed for a confident start.

<h2>Understanding Liquid Staking</h2>

<h3>The Traditional Staking Dilemma</h3>
<h4>What is Staking?</h4>
Staking is a cryptoeconomic mechanism that uses rewards and penalties to incentivize proper network behavior, thereby enhancing the underlying security. In proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains like Ethereum, participants run <Tooltip content={<><strong>Validator</strong> <br /> A <a href="./glossary#node" style={{textDecoration: 'underline', color: '#018970'}}>node</a> in a proof-of-stake system responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain. To activate validator software, you need to be able to stake 32 ETH.</>}>validator</Tooltip> nodes by putting tokens "at stake", meaning they earn rewards for validating transactions while risking "slashing" (penalties) for malicious or unreliable behavior. Validators play an essential role in maintaining network consensus, enabling all participants to agree on the blockchain's new irreversible global state. For this critical work, validators receive two types of rewards:

<ul>
  <li><span style={{fontWeight: '600'}}>Consensus Layer rewards</span>: Earned by performing validator duties like voting on block validity through attestations, participating in sync committees, and proposing blocks</li>
  <li><span style={{fontWeight: '600'}}>Execution Layer rewards</span>: Received as priority fees and Maximum Extractable Value (MEV)</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Liquidity Problem</h4>
Traditional PoS staking operates on a simple premise: lock tokens, earn fixed rewards, repeat. While this bond-like approach guarantees returns, it has a severe limitation: stake is illiquid. You are locked out of decentralized finance (DeFi) <Tooltip content={<><strong>Yield</strong> <br /> Returns or profits generated from an investment, typically expressed as an annual percentage. In DeFi, yield can come from lending, providing liquidity to trading pools, staking rewards, or other financial activities.</>}>yield</Tooltip> opportunities. Traditional staking creates a fundamental dilemma: you have to choose between earning staking rewards or maintaining liquidity. Liquid staking transcends this either-or paradigm by having the best of both worlds.

<h3>Solution</h3>
<h4>How Liquid Staking Works</h4>
Liquid staking transforms your stake into a tradeable asset through tokenization. When you stake through a liquid staking protocol, you receive liquid staking tokens (LSTs) representing your claim on the underlying staked assets plus accrued rewards. Unlike native staking where tokens are locked, LSTs remain liquid and composable. This unlocks the entire DeFi ecosystem while your original stake continues earning validation rewards. You can now earn from multiple sources:

- Staking rewards from your underlying validators
- DeFi yields from a multitude of opportunities: collateral for lending, yield farming strategies, or trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)

Liquid staking represents an epistemic shift in how staking works. With LSTs, you maintain exposure to staking rewards while having liquidity, breaking the disjunctive premise of traditional staking.

<h3>Staking Options</h3>
In order to participate in the Ethereum consensus mechanism, a staker must deposit 32 ETH. **Solo staking** can be prohibitive because of the minimum required 32 ETH and the requisite technical expertise. This accessibility barrier leads to the emergence of staking service providers that require no programming knowledge or hardware setup: **staking-as-a-service (SaaS)** and **centralized exchanges (CEXs)**. However, both come with significant concessions: SaaS providers still require the full 32 ETH minimum and offer no liquidity benefits, while centralized exchanges have one fundamental flaw ‚Äî centralization, which contradicts crypto's core decentralization principles. Despite attractive APRs, "not your keys, not your crypto," as the saying goes.

<h3>Decentralized Staking</h3>
<h4>Benefits of Decentralized Liquid Staking</h4>
Decentralized liquid staking protocols remove financial and technical barriers to staking and issue receipt tokens representing your stake. **Smart contracts** ensure that your funds remain secure and under your control. No centralized entity can access or confiscate your staked assets, as all operations are governed by transparent, immutable code on the blockchain. You can stake any desired amount with complete self-custody and no dependency on permission or intermediaries.

<h4>Centralized Decentralization</h4>
Liquid staking is not without risk considerations such as slashing, exploits, and secondary market volatility. But there is another element beneath surface-level observations: the validator set. The majority of liquid staking protocols employ fixed validator pools, potentially creating centralization around dominant node operators and leaving participants without transparency regarding stake allocation, ultimately undermining network decentralization. StakeWise resolves this centralization challenge by offering users complete control over their staking environment: either through creating their own Vault or selecting from a diverse set of available Vaults.

<h2>What is StakeWise?</h2>
StakeWise is a liquid staking protocol that gives you all the benefits you expect from permissionless and non-custodial staking and goes even further. Operating across Ethereum and Gnosis Chain, StakeWise creates a comprehensive staking network that serves diverse participant needs through three distinct approaches:

**One-Click Staking**: For users who want to start earning immediately with one-click, StakeWise offers streamlined staking that automatically allocates your stake across proven Vaults and provides instant OsToken liquidity without requiring any decisions or complexity.

**Vault Marketplace**: For advanced users seeking full control, choose from diverse Vault offerings with unique fee structures, MEV strategies, and risk profiles, empowering you to easily earn staking yields with complete control over your assets and validator selection.

**Solo Vaults**: For operators running their own infrastructure, launch your own liquid staking pools within minutes without significant upfront investment, creating and managing your own Vault while earning fees from other stakers.

StakeWise's tokenomics emerged from deep analysis of stakeholder motivations, engineering incentive structures that reinforce our decentralized vision while sustainably scaling the   protocol ‚Äî far more strategic than simply launching a token and hoping for adoption. StakeWise also continuously develops innovative strategies to maximize your rewards, such as <Tooltip content={<><strong>Boost</strong> <br /> Using OsToken as collateral, Boost safely borrows additional ETH to create a looped staking position, allowing you to earn the surplus between staking rewards and borrowing costs while maintaining built-in safety mechanisms to prevent liquidation risks. In DeFi jargon, this process is called leveraged staking: you borrow osETH and stake it again, increasing your exposure to staking rewards. Boost can literally boost your staking rewards by up to 3x.</>}>**Boost**</Tooltip>, with more features coming soon.

Our design philosophy centers on advancing decentralization through universal accessibility and meaningful choice.

<h3>Architecture</h3>
StakeWise's modular architecture is built on three foundational pillars: Vaults, OsToken, and Oracles.

<h4>Vaults: Customizable Smart Contracts</h4>
Vaults are isolated, highly customizable smart contracts that function as individual staking pools. Vault operators can accept deposits from other stakers, earning fees while providing staking services. The marketplace model democratizes liquid staking by giving you the freedom to choose where to stake and how.

<h4>Key Features:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Permissionless & Customizable: Launch your own Vault without approval, controlling fees, MEV strategies, and validator selection</li>
  <li>Open Marketplace: Choose from diverse Vaults based on your preferences for decentralization, yield, or specialized strategies</li>
  <li>Risk Isolation: Each Vault operates independently ‚Äî issues in one Vault don't affect others</li>
</ul>

<h4>OsToken: Next-Generation Liquid Staking Tokens</h4>
OsToken, standing for Overcollateralized Staking Token, is StakeWise's liquid staking token: osETH on Ethereum and osGNO on Gnosis Chain. Designed with safety and composability at its core, OsToken accrues staking rewards while maintaining full liquidity for DeFi participation. OsToken can be minted by anyone staking in Vaults or acquired directly from a DEX to instantly start earning staking rewards.

<h4>Key Features:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Protected & Rewarding: Overcollateralized design with auto-compounding rewards and slashing protection</li>
  <li>DeFi Ready: Fully compatible with lending, trading, and yield farming protocols</li>
</ul>

<h4>Oracles: Decentralized Infrastructure Layer</h4>
The decentralized oracle network bridges StakeWise smart contracts with Ethereum's <Tooltip content={<><strong>Beacon Chain</strong> <br /> Ethereum's consensus layer, a peer-to-peer network of consensus clients that handles block gossip and consensus logic. It is responsible for things like block and attestation handling, running the fork choice algorithm, and managing rewards and penalties for validators.</>}>Beacon Chain</Tooltip>, ensuring transparent, trustless operations while maintaining the protocol's security and non-custodial nature. Since Beacon Chain state is not directly accessible in the EVM (though [EIP-4788](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4788) aims to address this), oracles fetch essential validator data.

<h4>Key Functions:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Validator Lifecycle: Handle registration, consolidations, rewards, penalties, and exits</li>
  <li>Token Stability: Maintain accurate OsToken rates and ensure peg stability</li>
</ul>
