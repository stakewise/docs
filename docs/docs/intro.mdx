# The StakeWise Protocol

<h3>Introduction</h3>

This documentation is designed to guide you in using StakeWise to stake and operate in a non-custodial and permissionless manner, with full customization. It covers the protocol fundamentals, explains the protocol mechanics, and provides walkthroughs for a confident start.
Whether you are taking your first steps into liquid staking, running infrastructure, or navigating as a seasoned DeFi user, these pages help you unlock the potential of capital.

<h3>Understanding Liquid Staking</h3>

<h4>The Traditional Staking Dilemma</h4>
Staking is a cryptoeconomic mechanism that uses rewards and penalties to incentivize proper network behavior, thereby enhancing underlying security. Network participants can run validator nodes by putting tokens "at stake", which earn rewards for validating transactions but can also be "slashed" (taken as penalty) if the validator acts maliciously or unreliably. Traditional Proof-of-Stake staking operates on a simple premise: lock tokens, earn fixed rewards, repeat. While this bond-like approach guarantees returns, it has a severe limitation: stake is illiquid. You are locked out of decentralized finance (DeFi) yield opportunities. Traditional staking created a fundamental dilemma: you had to choose between earning staking rewards or maintaining liquidity. Liquid staking transcends this either-or paradigm by having the best of both worlds.

<h4>Solution</h4>
Liquid staking transforms your stake into a tradeable asset through tokenization. When you stake cryptocurrency through a liquid staking protocol, you receive <code style={{backgroundColor: '#f2f4f2'}}>os[token]</code> that represent your claim on the underlying staked assets plus accrued rewards. These <code style={{backgroundColor: '#f2f4f2'}}>os[token]</code> function as liquid representations of your stake, maintaining its value while making it tradeable. Unlike native staking where tokens are locked, <code style={{backgroundColor: '#f2f4f2'}}>os[token]</code> remains freely transferable and liquid. With liquid staking tokens, you unlock the entire DeFi ecosystem while your original stake continues earning validation rewards. You can now earn rewards from both staking and using your <code style={{backgroundColor: '#f2f4f2'}}>os[token]</code> in DeFi protocols‚Äîas collateral for lending, in yield farming strategies, or trading on decentralized exchanges. Liquid staking represents an epistemic shift in how staking must work. By holding <code style={{backgroundColor: '#f2f4f2'}}>os[token]</code>, you've effectively built a personal bank that earns staking rewards while participating in DeFi's endless opportunities.

<h4>Staking Options</h4>
In order to participate in the Ethereum consensus mechanism, a staker must deposit 32 ETH. Solo staking can be prohibitive for those who don't have the 32 ETH required by Ethereum and the requisite technical acumen. Traditional alternatives that require no in-depth programming knowledge or hardware setup include staking-as-a-service (SaaS) providers or centralized exchanges, but both come with trade-offs: SaaS providers still require the full 32 ETH minimum and provide no liquid staking benefits, while centralized exchanges have one intrinsic flaw: centralization, which contradicts crypto's original decentralization ethos. While APRs may appear attractive, "not your keys, not your crypto," as the saying goes.

<h4>Decentralized Staking</h4>
Decentralized liquid staking services eliminate financial and technical barriers to maximize your stake while letting you participate in DeFi. You can stake any amount you wish in a permissionless and non-custodial manner. Beyond the classical risk considerations‚Äîslashing, exploits, secondary market volatility‚Äîliquid staking protocols face an equally important architectural choice: validator selection and control. Most liquid staking protocols use pre-configured validator sets, which can lead to centralization around the biggest node operators. As a staker, you don't know where your stake will end up or have any say in the matter. This design choice fundamentally shapes your staking experience and your ability to actively participate in network decentralization. Some protocols prioritize operational simplicity with managed validator sets, while others prioritize user agency and transparency in validator selection.

<h3>What is StakeWise?</h3>

StakeWise is the premier liquid staking protocol on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain, enabling simple and secure staking for individuals and organizations, in a non-custodial and permissionless manner. Our design philosophy is simple: advancing decentralization by giving anyone the chance to stake on their own terms. StakeWise puts control in your hands. You can actively support decentralization by either running your own node or selecting specific operators that align with your unique staking goals. We provide tools and software that allow anyone to launch and configure their own staking pool (called a Vault) with full flexibility and earn fees by running validators for others.  This architecture delivers enhanced control across the entire staking stack‚Äîvalidator selection, fee structures, MEV strategies, and risk parameters‚Äîwhile preserving the non-custodial, permissionless nature that defines decentralized finance. Whether you're an individual staker, institutional investor, or infrastructure operator, StakeWise offers customizable solutions that let you operate nodes, mint <code style={{backgroundColor: '#f2f4f2'}}>os[token]</code>, and participate in DeFi protocols while maintaining complete asset custody.

StakeWise stays aligned with Ethereum's roadmap, researching upcoming changes and adapting proactively for optimal performance.

<h3>Core Architecture</h3>

StakeWise's architecture rests on three foundational pillars: Vaults, osToken, and Oracles.

<h4>Vaults</h4>
StakeWise pioneers the Vault marketplace model. Vaults are highly customizable smart contracts that can be used as a staking pool for any use case.
Anyone can launch a Vault, stake in Vaults, and mint osToken, with Vault operators earning a staking fee in exchange.
>üìù Learn how Vaults work, their isolation model, and how to create your own [Vaults ‚Üí](./intro.mdx)

<h4>osToken</h4>
osToken is the main liquid staking token for the StakeWise ecosystem, representing osETH on Ethereum and osGNO on Gnosis Chain. osTokens accrue native staking rewards when held and are minted by stakers in Vaults who want to use their stake in DeFi.
>üìù Explore osToken's inner mechanics, including its built-in slashing protection [osToken ‚Üí](./intro.mdx)

<h4>Oracles</h4>
Oracles calculate and submit periodic rewards for the Vaults. They also validate and sign validator registrations and consolidations.
