# StakeWise Overview

<h3>Protocol, Interface, DAO, Labs</h3>

StakeWise has several distinct areas that serve different purposes â€” here's how to tell them apart.

<ul>
  <li><strong>[StakeWise Protocol](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core)</strong>: A modular collection of smart contracts powering decentralized liquid staking on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain. The protocol includes customizable Vaults (including blocklist, private, and ERC20 variants), an over-collateralized token system (OsToken), validator lifecycle management, MEV capture and distribution, and governance controls.</li>
  <li><strong>[StakeWise Interface](https://app.stakewise.io/)</strong>: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the StakeWise protocol. The interface allows users to stake ETH, browse the Vault marketplace, create their own Vaults, and discover different DeFi strategies to maximize earnings.</li>
  <li><strong>[StakeWise DAO](https://vote.stakewise.io/#/)</strong>: A governance system for governing the StakeWise Protocol, enabled by the SWISE token.</li>
  <li><strong>[StakeWise Labs](https://x.com/stakewise_io)</strong>: The core development team behind StakeWise Protocol and its ecosystem tools.</li>
</ul>
