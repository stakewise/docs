# StakeWise Overview

<h3>Protocol, Interface, Labs</h3>

To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of StakeWise, some of which may confuse new users.

<ul>
  <li><strong>[StakeWise Protocol](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core)</strong>: A collection of smart contracts that power decentralized liquid staking. These contracts manage Vaults, Token System, Validator Management, Oracle operations, MEV management, and reward distribution across the ecosystem.</li>
  <li><strong>[StakeWise DAO](https://vote.stakewise.io/#/)</strong>: A governance system for governing the StakeWise Protocol, enabled by the SWISE token.</li>
  <li><strong>[StakeWise Labs](https://x.com/stakewise_io)</strong>: The company which developed the StakeWise protocol, along with the web interface.</li>
  <li><strong>[StakeWise Interface](https://app.stakewise.io/)</strong>: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the StakeWise protocol. The interface allows users to stake ETH, browse the Vault marketplace, create their own Vaults, and discover different DeFi strategies to maximize earnings.</li>
</ul>
