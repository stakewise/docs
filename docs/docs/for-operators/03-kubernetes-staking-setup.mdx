# Kubernetes Staking Setup

```

StakeWise is a DeFi protocol that offers a simple and safe way to stake ETH and GNO on favourable terms and to farm, restake, and borrow with your stake for more yield using osETH and osGNO, liquid staking tokens.&#x20;

StakeWise pioneers the concept of a staking marketplace that allows stakers to choose their own node operators, earn more staking profits, minimize slashing risk, and stake solo, all while keeping their stake liquid.&#x20;

StakeWise also provides individuals, communities and businesses with the tools to launch their own staking pools from scratch and give their users osTokens - osETH and osGNO - with an extensive liquidity & utility ecosystem developed by the StakeWise DAO.&#x20;

StakeWise is a good fit for you if you are:

- An everyday staker who wants a simple and secure solution for staking your capital, with the potential to use your staked capital in DeFi apps.
- A solo staker who wants to mint a liquid staking token against your own node, and also has the potential to offer fully trustless, non-custodial staking as a service to others.
- A whale/fund/DAO/institution looking for a bespoke staking solution to best suit your needs, whilst being able to access DeFi with staked capital.&#x20;

### osToken

```mdx-code-block
  <Tabs
    groupId="ostoken"
    defaultValue="oseth"
    values={[
      {label: 'osETH', value: 'oseth'},
      {label: 'osGNO', value: 'osgno'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="oseth">
      osETH is the main liquid staking token for the StakeWise ecosystem. With in-built slashing protection\* and yield accrual from a highly diversified set of node operators, osETH is a simple and secure way to stake ETH while preserving access to DeFi.&#x20;

      **In-built slashing protection**

      * 90% LTV Vaults are overcollateralized.
      * 99.99% Vault operators are required to place a 5M SWISE bond before such capability is provided by the StakeWise DAO.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="osgno">
      osGNO is the main liquid staking token for the StakeWise ecosystem on Gnosis Chain. With in-built slashing protection\* and yield accrual from a diversified set of node operators, osGNO is a simple and secure way to stake GNO while preserving access to DeFi.&#x20;

      **In-built slashing protection**

      * 90% LTV Vaults are overcollateralized.
      * 99.95% Vault operators are required to place a 1M SWISE bond before such capability is provided by the StakeWise DAO.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
