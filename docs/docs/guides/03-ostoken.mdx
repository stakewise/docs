#### Get started with osTokens using our how-to guides

osTokens is a generic name for liquid staking tokens of StakeWise - osETH on Ethereum and osGNO on Gnosis Chain. osETH represents staked ETH and osGNO represents staked GNO in StakeWise Vaults, enabling you to use staked capital in DeFi. Both osETH and osGNO are ERC-20 tokens.

No matter if you are staking in a Solo Vault or in a Vault Marketplace, you can mint osETH (on Ethereum) and osGNO (on Gnosis Chain) to make your stake liquid.

You can also convert ETH for osETH and GNO for osGNO to start staking with one click.

        It is possible to simply convert ETH into osETH to start staking in seconds. You will accrue ETH staking rewards by holding osETH in a wallet or in a smart contract.

        osETH can be converted back into ETH at any time to receive the initial deposit and accumulated rewards.

        [Read more about osETH →](./intro.mdx)

        Conversion of osETH back to ETH will utilize either exchanges where osETH is being traded or the osETH redemption mechanism, whichever has the more accurate value of osETH.

## Maintaining a healthy osToken position

        StakeWise DAO has the capability to increase or decrease the osETH minting threshold (LTV) based on any given Vault’s risk parameters. By default, Vaults have a 90% LTV threshold, which can be increased to 99.99% with DAOs approval, provided specific criteria are met.

        <b>90% LTV Vaults</b>

        Your stake in a 90% LTV Vault can be made liquid by minting osETH for up to 90% of your stake.

        This limit is set to ensure that penalties or slashing in your Vault do not affect other osETH holders. Conversely, you will not be affected by the penalties and slashing in other Vaults.

        If your liquid stake does not exceed 90% of the staked ETH value, your position is `Healthy`.

        At times, your liquid stake value may exceed the 90% limit and reach up to 92% due to the difference between your Vault's APY and osETH APY. Exceeding 90% but remaining below 91% is considered Moderate, and exceeding 91% but remaining below 92% is `Risky`.

        Exceeding 92% of your stake value in osETH is considered `Unhealthy`, and will lead to a forced return of your osETH position to a level below 90% through a process called liquidation. Liquidation incurs a 1% penalty on your stake.

        <b>99.99% LTV Vaults</b>

        In a 99.99% LTV Vault, you can mint osETH for up to 99.99% of your staked ETH. Your position is <b>always considered healthy</b> because osETH APY matches the APY of the lowest-yielding 99.99% LTV Vault. This ensures that your Vault's APY is never lower than osETH's APY. Thus, maintaining the stability of your position.

        Note that osETH not acquired by minting from a Vault does not require any maintenance and does not impact osETH position health.

            <li>Head to the Vault page and connect your wallet.</li>

            <li>It is recommended to keep a Healthy or Moderate position status. </li>
            <li>You should consider switching to a different Vault if your position status becomes Risky because it indicates significant underperformance of the Vault relative to the average and puts you at risk of liquidation.</li>
            <li>To improve your osETH position health, burn some osETH or stake more ETH into the Vault. However, it is not recommended to stake more ETH in a Vault where your position status deteriorated from Healthy to Risky. </li>
