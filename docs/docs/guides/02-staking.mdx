#### Get started with staking using our how-to guides

StakeWise is a liquid staking platform that gives you control over how your ETH and GNO are staked.

Whether you are a beginner, an advanced DeFi user, a solo staker, or an organization that requires a bespoke staking solution, StakeWise will help you stake ETH and GNO on the best terms and get osToken, a liquid staking token, to keep your stake liquid.

| Method              | Advantages                                                            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One-click staking   | Simplicity and protection from all slashing                           |
| Staking with Vaults | Higher yield, lower fee, protection from slashing in other Vaults     |
| Liquid solo staking | MEV smoothing, highest yield, lowest fee, full control over the stake |

Explore our how-to guides to start staking with StakeWise.

## One-click staking

```mdx-code-block
  <Tabs
    groupId="token"
    defaultValue="eth"
    values={[
      {label: 'ETH', value: 'eth'},
      {label: 'GNO', value: 'gno'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="eth">
        One-click staking relies on converting ETH for osETH, a liquid staking token of StakeWise. You will accrue ETH staking rewards by holding osETH in a wallet or in a smart contract.

        osETH can be converted back into ETH at any time to receive the deposit and accumulated rewards.

        <h2>How to stake ETH with one click</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Head to the [Stake](https://app.stakewise.io/) page in the StakeWise dApp and connect your wallet.</li>
            <li>Enter the amount of ETH you would like to stake. The interface will show the amount of osETH tokens you will receive in return.</li>
            <li>Note that the conversion ratio between osETH and ETH is >1 because osETH continuously accumulates staking rewards.</li>
            <li>Press Deposit and confirm the transaction in your wallet.</li>
            <li>Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, you will receive osETH in your wallet and begin staking.</li>
        </ol>

        One-click staking relies on converting GNO for osGNO, a liquid staking token of StakeWise on Gnosis Chain. You will accrue GNO staking rewards by holding osGNO in a wallet or in a smart contract.

        osGNO can be converted back into GNO at any time to receive the deposit and accumulated rewards.

## Staking with Vaults

```mdx-code-block
  <Tabs
    groupId="token"
    defaultValue="eth"
    values={[
      {label: 'ETH', value: 'eth'},
      {label: 'GNO', value: 'gno'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="eth">
        Staking with Vaults allows you to pick the specific terms on which your ETH will be staked, including the node operators that will run validators, relays used for MEV, and the staking fee.

        By staking in a particular Vault, you will earn ETH staking rewards only from that Vault's validators. You can unstake from a Vault at any time to receive the deposit and accumulated rewards.

        [Read more about Vaults →](../intro)

        Your stake in any Vault can be made liquid by minting osETH, a liquid staking token.

        <h3>How to stake with Vaults</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Head to the [Vault Marketplace](https://app.stakewise.io/) page in the StakeWise dApp and connect your wallet.</li>
            <li>Browse through the different Vaults using Performance, APY, and TVL as filters.</li>
            <li>Once you choose a Vault, press on the Stake button in the Vault interface.</li>
            <li>Enter the amount of ETH you would like to stake.</li>
            <li>Press the Stake button and confirm the transaction in your wallet.</li>
            <li>Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, you will start staking.</li>

        <h3>How to make your stake in the Vault liquid</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Head to the Vault page and connect your wallet.</li>
            <li>Press the Mint button.</li>
            <li>Enter the amount of osETH you want to mint or use the slider to choose the proportion of your stake that will be made liquid.</li>
            <li>Note that the maximum value of osETH you can mint is set to 90% of your stake in the Vault (99.99% for select Vaults). The profitability of your stake in the Vault is not reduced to the proportion you choose and remains fully intact.</li>
            <li>Press the Mint button and confirm the transaction in your wallet.</li>

## Liquid solo staking

        Liquid solo staking works by creating a Vault with desired parameters (e.g. MEV smoothing) and staking your ETH in it, triggering the launch of solo validators on your node.

        By staking in your Vault, you will earn ETH staking rewards only from your solo validators. You can unstake from your Vault at any time to receive the deposit and accumulated rewards.
