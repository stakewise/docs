# Boost Feature

## How Boost Works

StakeWise Boost enhances staking rewards by using osTokens as collateral to borrow additional assets on [Aave ↗](https://aave.com/). This borrowed capital is then staked again, creating a "looped" process that amplifies your staking position:

- **6x looping** in Vaults with 90% LTV
- **14x looping** in Vaults with 100% LTV
- **Up to 3x boost** in staking rewards compared to normal staking

:::custom-tips[Expected Returns]
The strategy extracts the difference between additional staking rewards and Aave borrowing costs, historically delivering 4-6% APY with peaks around 7%.

## Safety Mechanisms

:::custom-info[Liquidation Protection]
**Max LTV**: 93% - the maximum you can borrow against your osToken collateral

**Liquidation Threshold**: 95% - when positions become subject to liquidation

**Safety Buffer**: 2% - substantial protection before liquidation risk
:::

### Built-in De-risking

The Boost strategy includes automatic safety features that make positions progressively safer over time. When osToken APY exceeds borrow rates, your LTV decreases automatically, creating a self-improving mechanism. Historical analysis of 420 days shows that LTV only increases approximately 10.7% of the time (about 39 days per year), meaning for every 1 day of LTV increase, you benefit from 8 days of LTV decline.

### Price Stability Protection

Boost eliminates depeg-related liquidation risks through Aave's use of StakeWise's native price feed for osTokens instead of volatile secondary market prices. This means osToken price fluctuations on DEXs cannot trigger liquidations, as your collateral value always equals the osToken redemption value rather than market price. This design ensures that temporary market volatility doesn't endanger your boosted position.

## Emergency Safeguards

As an additional safety layer, Boost includes an "escape hatch" mechanism that activates when positions approach the liquidation threshold. When any boosted position reaches 94.5% LTV, anyone in the community can trigger an automatic unboosting transaction to protect the user. The StakeWise core team actively monitors all boosted positions and will trigger these protective exits when necessary, with all funds always remaining under the original owner's control.

:::custom-info[Risk Scenarios Analysis]
**Scenario 1: Negative yield spread** - Even in extreme cases where borrow rates consistently exceed osToken APY by 2%, liquidation would take over a year. Historical data shows this scenario occurs only 10.7% of days, with the longest consecutive period being just 7 days during Genesis Vault validator rotation.

**Scenario 2: Mass slashing events** - Would require unprecedented slashing of 480-1,150 validators across the protocol. StakeWise has maintained a perfect record with zero slashing events in 4 years of operation. Liquidation would require a 2.1% decline in osToken value from slashing.

## User Best Practices

While Boost includes comprehensive safety mechanisms, users should actively monitor their positions for optimal performance. Exit Boost if APY remains negative for more than 7 consecutive days, and stay connected with the StakeWise Discord community for real-time updates on market conditions. Regular check-ins on your position health ensure you're maximizing rewards while maintaining safety.
