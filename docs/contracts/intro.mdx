# How does StakeWise work?

```mdx-code-block
  <Tabs
    groupId="token"
    defaultValue="eth"
    values={[
      {label: 'ETH', value: 'eth'},
      {label: 'GNO', value: 'gno'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="eth">
      The main components of the StakeWise protocol are Vaults, osETH token, and Oracles.

      <h2>Vaults</h2>

      Users stake ETH into different Vaults and earn ETH rewards, while Vault operators earn a staking fee in exchange. Anyone can launch their own Vault to allow others to stake in it.

      [Read more about Vaults â†’](./intro.mdx)

      <h2>osETH</h2>

      osETH is a token for liquid staking that accrues ETH rewards to its holders. It can be used in DeFi to trade staked ETH and farm additional rewards.

      osETH is minted by stakers in Vaults that want to use their stake in DeFi. Anyone can swap their ETH for osETH in DeFi to start earning ETH rewards by holding the token.

      <h2>Oracles</h2>
âƒ—
      Oracles ensure that Vaults register validators without assuming custody of funds, calculate Vault rewards, and push information about validator registrations and exits on-chain.
