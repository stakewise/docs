# ERC20Upgradeable

[Git Source](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core/blob/c4059a64871829ca60ea58f054baf8eb13d3572a/contracts/base/ERC20Upgradeable.sol)

**Inherits:**
Initializable, IERC20Permit, IERC20, IERC20Metadata

**Author:**
StakeWise

Modern and gas efficient ERC20 + EIP-2612 implementation

## State Variables

### \_permitTypeHash

```solidity
bytes32 private constant _permitTypeHash =
    keccak256("Permit(address owner,address spender,uint256 value,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)");
```

### name

_Returns the name of the token._

```solidity
string public override name;
```

### symbol

_Returns the symbol of the token._

```solidity
string public override symbol;
```

### decimals

_Returns the decimals places of the token._

```solidity
uint8 public constant override decimals = 18;
```

### allowance

Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` is allowed
to spend on behalf of `owner`

```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public override allowance;
```

### nonces

_Returns the current nonce for `owner`. This value must be
included whenever a signature is generated for `{permit}`.
Every successful call to `{permit}` increases `owner`'s nonce by one. This
prevents a signature from being used multiple times._

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public override nonces;
```

### \_initialChainId

**Note:**
oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow: state-variable-immutable

```solidity
uint256 private immutable _initialChainId;
```

### \_initialDomainSeparator

```solidity
bytes32 private _initialDomainSeparator;
```

### \_\_gap

_This empty reserved space is put in place to allow future versions to add new
variables without shifting down storage in the inheritance chain.
See https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps_

```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap;
```

## Functions

### constructor

_Constructor_

_Since the immutable variable value is stored in the bytecode,
its value would be shared among all proxies pointing to a given contract instead of each proxyâ€™s storage._

**Note:**
oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow: constructor

```solidity
constructor();
```

### approve

Sets `amount` as the allowance of `spender` over the caller's tokens.

_Be aware of front-running risks: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729_

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool);
```

### transfer

Moves `amount` tokens from the caller's account to `to`.

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public virtual override returns (bool);
```

### transferFrom

Moves `amount` tokens from `from` to `to` using the allowance mechanism.
`amount` is then deducted from the caller's allowance.

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public virtual override returns (bool);
```

### permit

\*Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over `owner`'s tokens,
given `owner`'s signed approval.
IMPORTANT: The same issues `{IERC20-approve}` has related to transaction
ordering also apply here.
Emits an `{Approval}` event.
Requirements:

- `spender` cannot be the zero address.
- `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.
- `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`
  over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.
- the signature must use `owner`'s current nonce (see `{nonces}`).
  For more information on the signature format, see the
  https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP
  section].
  CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\*

```solidity
function permit(address owner, address spender, uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
    public
    override;
```

### DOMAIN_SEPARATOR

_Returns the domain separator used in the encoding of the signature for `{permit}`, as defined by `{EIP712}`._

```solidity
function DOMAIN_SEPARATOR() public view override returns (bytes32);
```

### \_computeDomainSeparator

Computes the hash of the EIP712 typed data

_This function is used to compute the hash of the EIP712 typed data_

```solidity
function _computeDomainSeparator() private view returns (bytes32);
```

### \_transfer

_Moves `amount` of tokens from `from` to `to`.
Emits a `{Transfer}` event._

```solidity
function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual;
```

### \_\_ERC20Upgradeable_init

_Initializes the ERC20Upgradeable contract_

```solidity
function __ERC20Upgradeable_init(string memory _name, string memory _symbol) internal onlyInitializing;
```

| --------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `_name`   | `string` | The name of the ERC20 token   |
