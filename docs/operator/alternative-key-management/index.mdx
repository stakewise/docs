# Alternative Key Management

Validator keystores don’t need to be stored locally — you may prefer to manage them externally for better security or flexibility.

This section covers three alternatives:

[Remote Signer→](./remote-signer) – isolate signing operations from your operator.

[HashiCorp Vault→](./hashicorp-vault) – integrate with enterprise-grade key management.

[Relayer (API Mode)→](./api-mode) – fully decouple key creation and storage from the operator.

Dive into each section to learn how these options work and how to implement them in your setup.
