# Alternative Key Management

Validator keystores don’t need to be stored locally—you may prefer to manage them externally for better security or flexibility.

This section covers three alternatives:

[Remote Signer →](./remote-signer) – Use external signing services (like [Web3Signer ↗](https://docs.web3signer.consensys.io/)) while keeping validator keys isolated from the Operator Service.

[HashiCorp Vault →](./hashicorp-vault) – Store validator signing keys in HashiCorp Vault instead of local files.

[Relayer (API Mode) →](./api-mode) – External service manages validator keystores and signs operations with the Validators Manager wallet via API calls.

Dive into each section to learn how these options work and how to implement them in your setup.
