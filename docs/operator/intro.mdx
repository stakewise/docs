# Operator Overview

Within the StakeWise protocol, anyone – from solo stakers to professional operators – can launch their own staking environment, called [Vault →](/docs/protocol-concepts/Vaults), and keep the stake in the Vault liquid with [osToken →](/docs/protocol-concepts/osToken), a liquid staking token of StakeWise.

Vault architecture serves diverse use cases: solo stakers can access liquid staking for their own ETH, while individuals and organizations can stake on their terms and offer liquid staking to others.

Each Vault requires a node operator, or a set of node operators, to stake the ETH deposited into the Vault, with each operator required to run StakeWise [Operator Service →](./operator-service).
