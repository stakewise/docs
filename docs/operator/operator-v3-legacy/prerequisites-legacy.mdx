# Prerequisites

Before installing and running the V3 Operator Service, ensure your node infrastructure meets the technical requirements below for reliable operation.

## Execution Client

Your execution node must be fully synced and running. Any client that supports the [ETH Execution API specification â†—](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/) can be used:

- **[Nethermind â†—](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/nethermind)** â€” (Ethereum, Gnosis)
- **[Besu â†—](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/besu)** â€” (Ethereum)
- **[Erigon â†—](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/erigon)** â€” (Ethereum, Gnosis)
- **[Geth â†—](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/geth)** â€” (Ethereum)
- **[Reth â†—](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth)** â€” (Ethereum)

:::custom-warning[Configure Erigon and Reth]
Preserve event logs to ensure the Operator Service functions correctly. Both clients require specific configuration to prevent event log pruning:

<Tabs groupId="special-config" defaultValue="erigon">
  <TabItem value="erigon" label="Erigon">
    ```bash
    # Ethereum Mainnet
    erigon --prune=receipts --prune.to=21471500

    # For other networks, adjust the block number to the Keeper contract creation block
    ```

  These flags prevent pruning of event logs required by the Operator Service.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="reth" label="Reth">
    Add the following setting to your `reth.toml`:

    ```toml
    [prune.segments.receipts_log_filter.0x6b5815467da09daa7dc83db21c9239d98bb487b5]
    before = 21471500
    ```

    The [Keeper contract â†—](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6B5815467da09DaA7DC83Db21c9239D98Bb487b5#code) on Ethereum Mainnet is located at
    `0x6b5815467da09daa7dc83db21c9239d98bb487b5` (must be provided in lowercase).
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Alternatively, to save disk space, you can use the block number at which the protocol configuration was updated. The actual values are defined in the [network config â†—](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-operator/blob/master/src/config/networks.py) within the Operator sources. See the `CONFIG_UPDATE_EVENT_BLOCK` field for the selected network.

## Consensus Client

Your consensus node must also be fully synced and running. Any client that supports the [ETH Beacon Node API specification â†—](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/#/) can be used:

- **[Lighthouse â†—](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/lighthouse)** â€” (Ethereum, Gnosis)
- **[Nimbus â†—](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/nimbus)** â€” (Ethereum, Gnosis)
- **[Prysm â†—](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/prysm)** â€” (Ethereum)
- **[Teku â†—](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/teku)** â€” (Ethereum, Gnosis)
- **[Lodestar â†—](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/lodestar)** â€” (Ethereum, Gnosis)

:::custom-info[Validator Configuration]
Configure your validator clients with the correct **fee recipient address**, which is available in the "Details" section of your Vault in the StakeWise interface.
:::

## Deployed Vault

You must have an active StakeWise Vault deployed and ready for operation.

### Creating a New Vault

If you don't have a Vault yet, follow these steps:

:::custom-notes[Vault Deployment Process]
1. Visit the [StakeWise Operate page â†—](https://app.stakewise.io/operate) and connect your wallet
2. Click **Create Vault** to begin configuration
3. Follow the prompts to complete the setup
4. Once the Vault is deployed, navigate to its page
:::

### Finding Your Vault Address

You will need the Vault contract address for Operator Service configuration:

:::custom-info[Where to Find Your Vault Address]
<Tabs groupId="vault-address-methods">
  <TabItem value="url" label="From URL" default>
    Navigate to your Vault page â€” the address is included in the URL:
    ```
    https://stakewise.io/vault/mainnet/0x1234567890abcdef...
                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                        Your Vault Address
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="details" label="From Details Section">
    1. Go to your Vault page
    2. Scroll to the bottom to find the **Details** section
    3. Look for the **Contract address** field
    4. Copy the displayed address
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
:::

## Network Support

:::custom-notes[Supported Networks]
- **Ethereum Mainnet** - Production network
- **Hoodi Testnet** - Primary Ethereum testnet
- **Gnosis Chain** - Alternative mainnet with GNO staking
- **Chiado Testnet** - Gnosis Chain testnet

Ensure your execution and consensus clients are connected to the same network and properly synchronized before starting the operator.

ðŸŽ‰ Once your infrastructure meets these requirements, you're ready to proceed with [V3 Operator setup â†’](./operator-v3-overview).
