## Self-Report to Rated Network

:::custom-info[What is Rated Network?]
Rated Network provides validator performance tracking and analytics. Self-reporting ensures your validators appear correctly in the Rated Explorer dashboard.
:::

To use the `submit-rated-network` command, you will need to provide the following parameters:

- `--vaults` - The comma separated list of your Vault addresses
- `--network` - The network of your Vault (e.g., mainnet, hoodi)
- `--token` - OAuth token for authorization
- `--data-dir` - Path where the Vault data will be placed (default: `~/.stakewise`)
- `--pool-tag` - The pool name listed on the Explorer

**Usage Example**
```bash
./operator submit-rated-network --vaults=0x000...,0x111... --network=mainnet --pool-tag=my-pool --token=your-oauth-token --data-dir=/data
```

:::custom-notes[Integration Complete]
Your validator data is now being reported to Rated Network for performance tracking and analytics.
