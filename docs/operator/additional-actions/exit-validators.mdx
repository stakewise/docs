# Exit Validators

The Operator Service automatically triggers validator exits when required.
By default, it checks every **12 hours** (configurable via `PARTIAL_WITHDRAWALS_INTERVAL`) to process queued withdrawal requests.
If partial withdrawals are not possible, the Operator Service initiates **full exits**.
If the Operator Service fails to exit validators within **24 hours**, **Oracles will step in** and perform the exits instead.
You can also use [manual exit](#manual-exit), although this command should only be used in extreme scenarios.

:::custom-info[Processing Time]
On mainnet, partial withdrawals typically complete faster (‚âà27‚Äì28 hours), while full exits can take **up to one month** to finalize.
:::

:::custom-info[Prerequisites]
- Wallet must be set as [Validators Manager ‚Üí](../validators-manager) in Vault settings. If the Validators Manager is set to the wallet address of the Relayer, you have to add the `--relayer-endpoint` parameter.
- Vault must be upgraded to version 5 (Ethereum) or version 3 (Gnosis)
:::

## Disable Automatic Withdrawals

You can disable partial withdrawals if you prefer to rely solely on full exits.
Use the `--disable-withdrawals` flag when starting the Operator Service:

```bash
./operator start \
  --vaults=0x3320a...68 \
  --disable-withdrawals
```

## Manual Exit

Manual exits should only be used in specific scenarios: emergency, maintenance, testing, etc.

```bash
./operator exit-validators
```
