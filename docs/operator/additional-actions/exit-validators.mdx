# Exit Validators

The Operator Service can trigger validator exits when needed, though exits are typically handled automatically by Oracles.

:::custom-info[Prerequisites]
- Wallet must be set as Validators Manager in Vault settings
- Vault must be upgraded to version 5 (Ethereum) or version 3 (Gnosis)
:::

## Basic Exit Command

```bash
./operator exit-validators
```

Are you sure you want to exit 3 validators with indexes: 513571, 513572, 513861? [y/N]: y
Validators 513571, 513572, 513861 exits successfully initiated
```

</details>

:::custom-info[Automatic Processing]
Validator exits are processed through the withdrawal queue system. The operator prioritizes partial withdrawals over full exits for better efficiency and faster processing times.
:::

:::custom-warning[Oracle Fallback]
If the operator does not initiate partial or full withdrawals within 24 hours, the oracle system will automatically execute full withdrawals to ensure funds are not stuck.
:::

## Advanced Options

### Disable Withdrawals

Use `--disable-withdrawals` flag when starting the Operator Service to rely solely on oracle-managed full exits:

```bash
./operator start-local \
  --vaults=0x3320a...68 \
  --disable-withdrawals
```

### Withdrawal Intervals

:::custom-notes[Environment Variables]
**`PARTIAL_WITHDRAWALS_INTERVAL`** - Controls how often partial withdrawals are processed (default: 24 hours)
