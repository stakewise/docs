# Exit Validators

Manually trigger validator exits when needed, though exits are typically handled automatically by oracles.

:::custom-info[Prerequisites]
- Wallet must be set as Validators Manager in vault settings
- Vault must be upgraded to version 5 (Ethereum) or version 3 (Gnosis)
:::

## Usage Options

### Basic Exit Command

```bash
./operator exit-validators
```

### Exit Specific Validators

Exit specific validators using the `--indexes` parameter:

```bash
./operator exit-validators --indexes=513571,513572,513861
```

:::custom-info[Process Flow]
1. **Endpoint Configuration**: System confirms consensus and execution endpoints
2. **Vault Verification**: Confirm the vault address
3. **Validator Selection**: Choose which validator indexes to exit
4. **Final Confirmation**: Review and confirm the list of validators to be exited
5. **Execution**: Validator exits are initiated on-chain

```bash
Enter the comma separated list of API endpoints for execution nodes: : https://example.com
Enter the comma separated list of API endpoints for consensus nodes: https://example.com
Enter your vault address: 0x3320ad928c20187602a2b2c04eeaa813fa899468
Are you sure you want to exit 3 validators with indexes: 513571, 513572, 513861? [y/N]: y
Validators 513571, 513572, 513861 exits successfully initiated
```

## Exit Processing Methods

### Partial Withdrawals (Preferred)

- Faster and more efficient than full exits
- Processes validators with balances above 32 ETH/1 GNO
- Maintains validator active status while withdrawing excess

### Full Validator Exits

- Used when partial withdrawals are insufficient
- Completely removes validators from the network
- Processed through execution request calls or oracle management

:::custom-info[Automatic Processing]
Validator exits are processed through the withdrawal queue system. The operator prioritizes partial withdrawals over full exits for better efficiency and faster processing times.
:::

:::custom-warning[Oracle Fallback]
If the operator does not initiate partial or full withdrawals within 24 hours, the oracle system will automatically execute full withdrawals to ensure funds are not stuck.
:::

## Advanced Options

### Disable Withdrawals

Use `--disable-withdrawals` flag when starting the operator to rely solely on oracle-managed full exits:

```bash
./operator start-local \
  --vaults=0x3320a...68 \
  --disable-withdrawals
```

### Withdrawal Intervals

:::custom-notes[Environment Variables]
**`PARTIAL_WITHDRAWALS_INTERVAL`** - Controls how often partial withdrawals are processed (default: 24 hours)
