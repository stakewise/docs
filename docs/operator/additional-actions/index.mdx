# Additional Actions

Running validators doesn’t stop at registration — operators also need tools to add extra rewards and manage them efficiently, monitor performance, upgrade validators, and eventually exit them when required.

The StakeWise Operator Service includes a set of additional actions designed to make Vault management easier, more efficient, and more transparent.

With these tools, you can:

[Automate fee claiming →](./fee-claiming) – distribute rewards to shareholders based on the set percentages.

[Monitor performance →](./monitoring) – track metrics and rewards in real time with Prometheus, Grafana, and Rated Network integration.

[Consolidate validators →](./consolidate-validators) – upgrade legacy validators for Pectra compatibility and reduce infrastructure overhead.

[Exit validators →](./exit-validators) – safely withdraw validators when needed.

Dive into each action to see when it’s useful and how to set it up in your environment.
