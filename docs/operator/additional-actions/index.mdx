# Overview

Beyond core validator registration, the StakeWise Operator supports several additional actions to enhance Vault management and operational efficiency.

## Available Actions

### Enable Fee Claiming
Automate reward withdrawals for Vault fee shareholders through the Reward Splitter system. Configure periodic claiming with customizable intervals and minimum thresholds.
Essential for Vault operators with multiple fee shareholders who want automated reward distribution.

### Enable Monitoring
Track Vault performance and incentive distributions. Monitor various token rewards (SWISE, osETH, SSV, Obol, WETH, USDC) and access comprehensive reporting through the StakeWise App interface.
Recommended for all operators who want to track performance and reward distributions across their validator operations.

### Consolidate Validators
Convert legacy `0x01` validators to efficient `0x02` compound validators for Pectra upgrade compatibility. Support for balances above 32 ETH/1 GNO, improved partial withdrawals, and reduced operational overhead. Required for operators upgrading to Pectra and wanting to maximize validator efficiency with modern validator types.
