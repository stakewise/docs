# Monitoring

The Operator Service supports monitoring using Prometheus by providing a `/metrics` endpoint that Prometheus can scrape to gather various metrics about your validator operations.

:::custom-info[Prerequisites]
- Operator application running and accessible
- Prometheus server installed and running
- Basic knowledge of how to configure Prometheus targets
- [Grafana Dashboard ↗](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/19060-v3-operator/) for [v3-operator ↗](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-operator) installed
:::

## Setup Operator for Monitoring

The Operator provides flexibility to define the host and port for the metrics endpoint via environment variables:

:::custom-notes[Environment Variables]
**`ENABLE_METRICS`** - Defines whether the metrics endpoint should be enabled (default: `false`)

**`METRICS_HOST`** - Defines the hostname or IP on which the metrics endpoint will be available

**`METRICS_PORT`** - Defines the port on which the metrics endpoint will be available
:::

Ensure that these environment variables are set as per your requirements.

:::custom-notes[Environment Variables Example]
```bash
export ENABLE_METRICS=true
export METRICS_HOST=0.0.0.0
export METRICS_PORT=9100
```
:::

:::custom-info[Command-Line Flags]
You can also specify them by providing `--enable-metrics`, `--metrics-port` and `--metrics-host` flags to the start command.
:::

The Operator Service's metrics will be available at `http://[METRICS_HOST]:[METRICS_PORT]/metrics`.

## Configure Prometheus

To monitor the Operator, configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the exposed `/metrics` endpoint.

Add the following job configuration to your Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`):

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'operator'
    scrape_interval: 30s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['<METRICS_HOST>:<METRICS_PORT>']
```

Replace `<METRICS_HOST>` and `<METRICS_PORT>` with the values you've configured in the Operator.

This configuration tells Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Operator every 30 seconds.
